# Beekeeper ↔ Nextcloud Automation

This project provides **Node.js scripts** to automate the transfer of documents:

* **Upload files to Beekeeper** – upload single files or entire local folders into a
  specific folder of the Beekeeper Document Library.
* **(planned) Download files from Nextcloud** – scripts to fetch files from a Nextcloud
  folder via the Nextcloud API (coming soon).
